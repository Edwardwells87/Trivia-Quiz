## Technologies Used

* I utilized VS Code to make the majority of this project

## Description
The 90s trivia quiz is poorly styled after what a kid might have seen if they checked out a "cool" website during that era. The questions are simple enough and functionality is too. Don't answer any sketchy questions the game may ask you.
